# Hi Stefan,
# 
# as you mentioned the data preprocessing is different for part A (10 sunscreens) since 
# its raw data was differently processed 
#(It just had negative polarity and also the masses were normalized beforehand)!!!
# Is it possible that we have  2 parts in github as part A (first data set -
#                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           10 sunscreen) and part B (second data set - 3 sunscreen) ?
#   
# For the rest of the codes, we tried to make them similar to what we already had in Github.
# The hierarchical clustering did not change but k -
#   mean changed (there are 15 clusters in the new version where in old version there were 16). 
# I think I should change this figure then in SI (figure S2).
# 
# Attached you can find the raw data and the codes of part A (first data set -
#                                                               10 sunscreen).
