## **Content overview**

### - /R

For reproducing the data analysis. Run first *Set_up.R*. The path to the data must be specified by the user in *Set_up.R*.

### - /Cache

The *Cache* folder holds intermediate objects created during data analysis

### - /Raw_data

Two types of analysis have been carried out: A) focussing on general sorption patterns (sunscreens 1 to 10) and B) searching for important masses that could explain differences in sorption between samples with and without fulvic acids (sunscreens 3, 4, and 9).
